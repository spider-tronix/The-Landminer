# The-Landminer
*Remote controlled landmine detection bot assited by Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Metal detector.*


## Problem statement:

It is estimated that around 110 million landmines are active and buried in the soil due to the war between nations and an equal amount is in stockpile waiting to be planted. Our goal is to locate the presence of the landmine both accurately and quicker.


## Why ? :

As the consequence of the buried landmine the casualty rises up to 10,000 people every year and the arable lands cannot be ploughed and left as it is due to the presence of active landmines.

## How ? :

The existing methods are inefficient. We locate the presence of the mine by Ground Penetrating Radar along with metal detector attached to the bot that probes the land efficiently.
