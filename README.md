# The-Landminer
This repository contains a ground-penetrating radar assisted landmine detection bot. 
Landmines kill and maim approximately 26,000 people annually. There are presently
approximately 500 million live, buried mines in about 70 countries, which present a
major threat to lives and cause economic problems. Direct casualties are not the only
problem. In some places, whole areas of arable land cannot be farmed due to the
threat of landmines. Current demining techniques are heavily reliant on metal
detectors and prodders. In many circumstances, the prodder is the first and the last
resort. The advent of non-disturbance fused mines makes prodding a dangerous
operation. Mechanical devices such as ploughs, rollers, and flails are usually followed
by manual demining to obtain the desired level of clearance.
These machines are expensive for developing countries.In order to compensate the drawbacks,
metal detector along with Ground Penetrating Radar is used. This ultra-wide band radar 
provides centi-meter resolution to locate even small targets. GPR operates by detecting the 
dielectric contrasts in the soils, which allows it to locate even non-metallic mines.
